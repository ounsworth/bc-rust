//! A helper class used across the bc-rust library to hold bytes-like key material.
//! The main purpose is to hold metadata about the contained key material such as the key type and
//! entropy content to prevent accidental misuse security bugs, such as deriving cryptographic keys
//! from uninitialized data.
//! The core idea of this wrapper is to keep track of the usage of the key material, including
//! the amount of entropy that it is presumed to contain in order to prevent users from accidentally
//! using it inappropriately in a way that could lead to security weaknesses.
//!
//! Various operations within the bc-rs library will consume or produce KeyMaterial objects with
//! specific key types. In normal use of the bc-rs APIs, users should never have to manually convert
//! the type of a KeyMaterial object because the various function calls will set the key type appropriately.
//!
//! Some typical workflows would be:
//!
//! * Hash functions take in \[u8\] byte data and return a KeyMaterial of type RawUnknownEntropy.
//! * Password-based key derivation functions act on KeyMaterial of any type, and in the case of RawFullEntropy, RawLowEntropy, or RawUnknownEntropy, will preserve the entropy rating.
//! * Keyed KDFs that are given a key of RawFullEntropy or KeyedHashKey a KeyMaterial data of type RawLowEntropy or RawUnknownEntropy will promote it into RawFullEntropy.
//! * Symmetric ciphers or asymmetric ciphers such as X25519 or ML-KEM that accept private key seeds will expect KeyMaterial of type AsymmetricPrivateKeySeed.
//!
//! However, there is a [`KeyMaterialTrait::set_key_type`] for cases where the user has more context knowledge than the library.
//! Some conversions, such as converting a key of type RawLowEntropy into a SymmetricCipherKey, will fail unless
//! run inside of a [`do_hazardous_operations`] closure, see below.
//!
//! # 🚨 Security 🚨
//!
//! Additional security features:
//!   * Zeroizes on destruction.
//!   * Implementing Display and Debug to print metadata but not key material to prevent accidental logging.
//!
//! # Hazardous Operations
//!
//! This object allows several types of manual-overrides, many of which are considered
//! "hazardous operations" since by definition they are allowing you to bypass checks meant to detect
//! conditions that could lead to security vulnerabilities.
//! Consider, for example, that you are reading a symmetric key from somewhere outside the library,
//! maybe from disk or from another process, but maybe you handed in the wrong variable and instead
//! handed in an uninitialized (all-zero) buffer.
//! Since this is a common bug that has catestrophic security implications, the library will normally
//! check for all-zero KeyMoterial objects and throw an error.
//! But there will be cases in which you really do need to use an all-zero key, so you can create
//! one if you do it in hazardous operations mode.
//!
//! Examples of hazardous conversions that are required to be run inside of a do_hazardous_operations() closure:
//!
//! * Converting a KeyMaterial of type RawLowEntropy or RawUnknownEntropy into RawFullEntropy or any other full-entropy key type.
//! * Converting any algorithm-specific key type into a different algorithm-specific key type, which is considered hazardous since key reuse between different cryptographic algorithms is generally discouraged and can sometimes lead to key leakage.
//!
//! As with all wrappers of this nature, the intent is to protect the user from making silly mistakes, not to prevent expert users from doing what they need to do.
//! It as always possible, for example, to extract the bytes from a KeyMaterial object, manipulate them, and then re-wrap them in a new KeyMaterial object.
//!
//! See [`do_hazardous_operations`] for documentation and sample code.
