/// Extensible Output Functions (XOFs) are similar to hash functions, except that they can produce output of arbitrary length.

/// and then a squeeze phase in which an arbitrary amount of output is extracted.
/// Once squeezing begins, no more input can be absorbed.

/// since the amount of output to produce is not provided to the XOF in advance, it cannot be used to
/// diversify the XOF output streams.
/// In other words, the overlapping parts of their outputs will be the same!
/// For example, consider two XOFs that absorb the same input data, one that is squeezed to produce 32 bytes,
/// and the other to produce 1 kb; both outputs will be identical in their first 32 bytes.

/// it is sufficient for the attacker to know that two values came from the same input, even if the
/// attacker cannot learn what that input was. This is attack is often sufficient, for example,
